# largedeviations-liquidcrystals
This repo can be used to reproduce the graphs shown in [Exceptionally Large Fluctuations in Orientational Order: The Lessons of Large-Deviation Theory for Liquid Crystalline Systems](https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jcp/article/162/2/024501/3329531/Exceptionally-large-fluctuations-in-orientational)

It includes two things:

1) The molecular dynamics data for the orientational order of the liquid crystal molecules both in 2D and 3D. More information can be found in the paper and in the moleculardynamics repo. 

2) Secondly, it includes the Python code that was used to plot the probability distribution of the the orientational order, as well as the LDT and CLT curves described in the above publication.
